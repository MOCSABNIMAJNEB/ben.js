# Ben.JS Tutorial

This folder contains the tutorial application which can be used as a template for custom proejcts. 
See more details at [http://www.benjs.org/tutorial.html](http://www.benjs.org/tutorial.html)

*Note* This tutorial uses Ajax calls to load page fragments into the application. If you did not load your files form a web server this will result in a 'Cross origin Exception'. To avoid this during developing the application locally you can start the chromium browser in a developer mode with the following command: 

    # Linux
    chromium --allow-file-access-from-files
    # Windows
    chromium -allow-file-access-from-files
